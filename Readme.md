SOLID Principles in Kotlin

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the SOLID principles using the Kotlin programming language. The SOLID principles are fundamental design guidelines that help in building maintainable, scalable, and robust software. Each principle is illustrated through practical examples in Kotlin.


Principles Covered

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
Ensures a class has only one reason to change by focusing on a single responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 
Promotes the extension of software entities without modifying their existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): 
Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
Encourages the creation of specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 
High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than on low-level modules.
