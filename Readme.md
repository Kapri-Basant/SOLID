This Repo contains an implementation of the SOLID principles in Kotlin.

The repository includes code examples that demonstrate each principle, such as the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. 

The project structure follows standard Kotlin practices, and the code is organized to illustrate how these principles can be applied in real-world scenarios.
